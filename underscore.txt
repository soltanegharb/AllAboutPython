""""Name Mangling" refers to the process by which the Python interpreter changes the name of a variable or method to include the class name, helping to avoid naming conflicts in subclasses.

"""magic methods are specifically designed for objects in Python. These methods allow you to define or customize the behavior of instances of your classes when they interact with built-in Python functions and operators. Here are some key points to understand:

Object-Oriented: Magic methods are integral to Python's object-oriented programming. They allow you to define how your objects behave in various situations.

Class Instances: Magic methods are defined within classes and are called on instances of those classes (objects).

Customization: They help customize behaviors like initialization (__init__), string representation (__str__), calling the object as a function (__call__), indexing (__getitem__), and more."""
